RDS Connections:

-> Install MySQL Client
Copy paste the below in the EC2 user-data field

#!/bin/bash
yum -y install mysql-client
  
or

apt-get install mysql-client

-> How to Connect to RDS from EC2
#mysql -h <Your-RDS-Endpoint> -P 3306 -u dbmaster -p
For Example,

#mysql -h myinstance.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -P 3306 -u dbmaster -p

If the above is giving errors, try disabling selinux by issuing this command setenforce 0 to troubleshoot the issue. Once you are set, re-enable SELinux with the appropriate privileges.

-> Another area to be sure is to get the AWS Security Groups to allow traffic on port 3306 from your Source IP or web-app Security Group

Show Databases
show databases;
use <database-name>;
show tables;

-> You can retrieve the number of active connections to an Amazon RDS
SHOW STATUS WHERE `variable_name` = 'Threads_connectedâ€™;

-> Retrieve the maximum number of connections allowed for an Amazon RDS
SELECT @@max_connections;
We will look into CRUD basics now,

-> Create Tables
   We will create a Students table with Student ID, Name & City as Columns
   
CREATE TABLE Students ( StudentID int, LastName varchar(255), FirstName varchar(255), City varchar(255) );

-> Insert records into tables

INSERT INTO Students ( StudentID, LastName, FirstName, City) VALUES ( "001", "Kumar", "Anil", "Singapore" );

INSERT INTO Students ( StudentID, LastName, FirstName, City) VALUES ( "002", "Reddy", "M", "Hyderabad" );

INSERT INTO Students ( StudentID, LastName, FirstName, City) VALUES ( "003", "Reddy", "N", "Hyderabad" );

INSERT INTO Students ( StudentID, LastName, FirstName, City) VALUES ( "004", "Vel", "D", "Chennai" );

INSERT INTO Students ( StudentID, LastName, FirstName, City) VALUES ( "005", "Student", "Martian", "Mars" );

-> Retrieve records from table
select * from Students;

-> Making specific queries
select StudentID from Students WHERE (LastName="Reddy");
select StudentID,City from Students WHERE (LastName="Reddy");

->Delete Tables
drop tables Students;
